# Public Health Insights — Disease Trends & Healthcare Access

**Interactive Tableau dashboards** for visualizing disease incidence, vaccination coverage, healthcare facility distribution, and demographic risk patterns.  
This project uses open public-health datasets (India + global) to identify high-risk regions and support data-driven public health planning.

---

## Project Overview
This repository contains Tableau workbooks, processed datasets, and documentation for interactive dashboards that explore:
- Disease incidence and time trends  
- Vaccination coverage and immunity gaps  
- Healthcare facility distribution and accessibility  
- Risk heatmaps (region / age / gender)  
- Age-wise and gender-wise disease patterns

Use these dashboards to explore hotspots, resource gaps, and demographic vulnerabilities for targeted interventions.

---

## Objectives
- Visualize disease trends (time series, moving averages, peaks)  
- Map healthcare infrastructure (hospitals, PHCs, CHCs) and access disparities  
- Measure vaccination coverage and identify under-vaccinated areas  
- Create risk heatmaps and demographic breakdowns (age/gender/region)  
- Produce actionable insights for policymakers, NGOs, and health program managers
